## Google I/O 2015 web app

### Setup

Prerequisites

* [Go 1.4](https://golang.org/dl/).
* Optional: [gcloud tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/#Quick_Start)
  and [app](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud-app#Installation) component
  to run and deploy GAE-based backend (hint: `gcloud components update app`).

  Once `gcloud` and `app` component are installed, you'll need to do a one-off
  configuration by executing the following command: `gcloud config set project <project-id>`.
  Project ID can be any non-empty string if you just want to run the app locally.

Setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ioweb2015.git`
2. `cd ioweb2015`
3. `npm install`
4. `gulp setup`
5. `npm install -g webpack` (needed for the experiment)

If you plan on modifying source code, be a good citizen and:

1. Install [EditorConfig plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) for your favourite browser.
   The plugin should automatically pick up the [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) settings.
2. Obey the pre-commit hook that's installed as part of `gulp setup`.
   It will check for JavaScript and code style errors before committing to the `master` branch.

### Running

Run `gulp serve` to start a standalone backend, while still enjoying live-reload.
You'll need Go for that.

Normally the app is running in "dev" environment but you can change that
by providing `--env` argument to the gulp task:

  ```
  # run in dev mode, default:
  gulp serve
  # set app environment to production:
  gulp serve --env prod
  # or run as if we were in staging:
  gulp serve --env stage
  ```

Not that this does not change the way the backend code is compiled
or the front-end is built. It merely changes a variable values,
which the app takes into account when rendering a page or responding to a request.

Running in `stage` or `prod` requires real credentials when accessing external services.
You'll need to run a one-off `gulp decrypt` which will decrypt a service account private key.

You can also use GAE dev appserver by running `gulp serve:gae`. This is closer to what
we're using in our webapp environment but a bit slower on startup.
You'll need `gcloud` tool and `app` component to do this.

To change the app environment when using GAE SDK, provide `--env` argument:

  ```
  # run in dev mode, default:
  gulp serve:gae
  # set app environment to production:
  gulp serve:gae --env prod
  # or run as if we were in staging:
  gulp serve:gae --env stage
  ```

Other arguments are:

* `--no-watch` don't watch for file changes and recompile relative bits.
* `--open` open serving url in a new browser tab on start.
* `--reload` enable live reload. Always watches for file changes; `--no-watch` will have no effect.

### Building

Run `gulp`. This will create `dist` directory with both front-end and backend parts, ready for deploy.

**Note**: Build won't succeed if either `gulp jshint` or `gulp jscs` reports errors.

You can also serve the build from `dist` by running `gulp serve:dist`,
and navigating to http://localhost:8080.

`serve:dist` runs the app in `prod` mode by default. You can change that
by providing the `--env` argument as with other `serve` tasks. For instance:

  ```
  # run in stage instead of prod
  gulp serve:dist --env stage
  ```

### Deploying

To deploy complete application on App Engine:

1. Run `gulp` which will build both frontend and backend in `dist` directory.
2. Run `gcloud preview app deploy dist/backend --version <v>`.

The app will be deployed to the project configured in `gcloud` tool.
To check which project you're deploying to, run `gcloud config list`
and look for `project = ...` line.

## Backend

Backend is written in Go. It can run on either Google App Engine or any other platform as a standalone
binary program.

`gulp backend` will build a self-sufficient backend server and place the binary in `backend/bin/server`.

`gulp backend:test` will run backend server tests. If, while working on the backend, you feel tired
of running the command again and again, use `gulp backend:test --watch` to watch for file changes
and re-run tests automatically.

Add `--gae` cmd line argument to the test task to run GAE-based tests.


## Debugging

A list of tools to help in a debugging process.
**NOT available in prod**

### Proxy with the service account credentials

```
http://HOST/io2015/debug/srvget?url=<some-url>
```

The backend will GET `some-url` and respond back with the original
status code, content-type header and the content.

Useful for browsing original CMS data on staging GCS bucket:

### Send GCM push notifications

```

```

Follow instructions on that page.

On staging server this is [go/iowastaging/debug/push](http://go/iowastaging/debug/push)


### Re-sync local datastore with remote

```
