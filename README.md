## Google I/O 2015 web app

### Setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ioweb2015.git`
2. `cd ioweb2015`
3. `npm install`
4. `gulp setup`

If you plan on modifying source code, be a good citizen and:

1. Install [EditorConfig plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) for your favourite browser.
   The plugin should automatically pick up the [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) settings.
2. Obey the pre-commit hook that's installed as part of `gulp setup`.
   It will check for JavaScript and code style errors before committing to the `master` branch.

### Running

Start a web server in `app/` or server via App Engine dev server.

**Note**: You have to run `gulp` or `gulp compass` at least once to generate CSS from the .scss files.

### Building

Run `gulp`. Then hit `http://localhost:<PORT>/dist/app/`. The unbuilt version is still viewable at `http://localhost:<PORT>/app/` but will not contain minfied JS or vulcanized HTML Imports.

**Note**: Build won't succeed if either `gulp jshint` or `gulp jscs` reports errors.
